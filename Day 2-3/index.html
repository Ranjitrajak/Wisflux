        <p>
            Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications. It is a broad
            term involving various technologies, including web design, web content management,
            web scripting, web server, and web browser. We can also refer to the web development
            process as the development of a website.This document contains a list of the most
            common web development technologies and tools.

        <h2 id="web">what is web browser</h2>
        <p>
            A web browser is application software for accessing the World Wide Web or a local
            website. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser
            retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the
            user's device


        </p>
        <h2 id="client">What is Client and Client Side</h2>
        <p>
            It is simply a service consumer. In web development, 'client side' refers to everything in a
            web application that is displayed or takes place on the client (end user device). This
            includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any
            actions that an application performs within the user's browser

        </p>
        <h2 id="html">Basic HTML</h2>
    
        <p>
           <span style="font-size: larger;color:blue;">HyperText:</span>  HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text that has a link within it is
            a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have
            clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML
             documents) with each other.<br>
          <span style="font-size: larger;color:blue;">Markup language:</span> A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply
           layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text
           more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.<br>
         <span style="font-size: larger;color:blue;">Web Page:</span> A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and
         translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web
         page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create
         static web pages.

        </p>
        <h2 id="css">Basic CSS</h2>
        <p>
            <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</span> is a language for styling the webpage. We can change the
            appearance and the layout of the webpage by using CSS. We can also define how a
            website's view changes in different screens like desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
            CSS is not a programming language, like C++ or JavaScript..
